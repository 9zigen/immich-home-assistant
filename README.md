# Immich integration for Home Assistant

This custom integration for Home Assistant allows you to display random pictures from your Immich instance inside Home Assistant.

The pictures will be provided under an `image` entity, which should work with other Home Assistant components, like the `picture` card.

A random image will be fetched every 5 minutes.
The images are selected from your Favorites on your Immich instance.
